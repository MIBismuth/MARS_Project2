# MARS_Project2

This repo contains all the code used in the analysis of our data extracted from the airpord model in UPPAAL SMC.

## Creating the processed data files

The raw data from the simulations can be found on the simulations_* folders. To generate the processed data csv's, run:

```bash 
python analisys.py
```

## Running the analysis 
To replicate the data analisys found on the report (all the plots, fits, etc.), run any of the other python scripts.
